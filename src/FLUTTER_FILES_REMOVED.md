- `main.dart.bak` - Backup of main Flutter entry point
- `pubspec.yaml` - Flutter project configuration and dependencies

### Flutter Source Code (`lib/` directory):
- `lib/constants.dart` - Flutter constants and app configuration
- `lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart` - Flutter state management provider
- `lib/providers/ride_provider.dart` - Flutter ride state provider

### Flutter Screens (`lib/screens/` directory):

- `/App.tsx` - Main React application
- `/components/` - All React components
- `/hooks/` - React hooks

- `/styles/` - CSS styles
- `/utils/` - TypeScript utilities

## Performance Benefits:
